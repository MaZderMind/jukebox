Jukebox Raspberry Pi HAT
========================

This RaspberryPi HAT is an adaptor to connect the old input-panel of my Jukebox (Made in the Germany of the mid 60s) to a modern RasperryPi.
Here is a Twitter-Thread of the complete project: https://twitter.com/mazdermind/status/1204149106270261249

This HAT itself is probably not of any use to anyone else, but it might be of educational use to someone.
